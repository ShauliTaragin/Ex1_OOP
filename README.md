<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Exercise 1 Object-Oriented Programming

This Exercise is a focus for learning python when it is actually a sequel to exercise 0 (performed in java). As usual, it is recommended to start planning the exercise (without a code) and only after we have a basic plan should we move on to the implementation phase of the code.
Similar to exercise 0, this exercise also opens an algorithm for a system of elevators and the amount of high-rise building.
In this exercise the challenge will be to deal with the offline version of the problem - meaning all the readings are given to us in advance, and we just need to stroke each reading in general (so that the rule of waiting for elevators is kept to a minimum). In fact the current exercise is mostly practical in the challenge of assigning a "call" to the elevator, but to accomplish this properly you will also need to understand and simulate the movement of the fillings.

## The Algorithm

Our offline algorithm for elevators is designed as follows:

For the first time we use all the information available to us in an offline algorithm such as the number of elevators in the building, the Calls information such as (Call source, Call destination, Call times), We will implement the departments (Building, Elevator, Calls) for each elevator we will create 2 lists, one contains all the floors from the calls that are placed, the other contains all the times that the elevator runs its route to the destination call, we will go through all the elevators. For each elevator we will copy the calls that exist in it into a copy of a list of the same elevator. And we will check for each elevator- given the insertion of the source and destination call into the list in their correct location how long it will take for the elevator to make all its calls.
We will use the helper function that updates us on the total time it will take for the elevator to make all its calls (go through all the organs list "copy"). The elevator that will be assigned to the call is the elevator that will complete all its calls, including the new call that was completed in the shortest time.
After locating the optimal elevator we are called to the auxiliary function again only this time we will put in the original list of that elevator the new call in its correct location. And we'll bring back the same elevator.

## Code Details


Unified Modeling Language (UML) :

<p align="center">
<img align="center" src="https://s8.gifyu.com/images/UML.png" />
</p>


Our class Building reading a json with containing a building with minimum floor and maximum floor, list  of elevators
we added a numbers of elevators function to help us in later.  Elevator class contains all information about each elevator speed close time doors etc.. 
Calls class is reading the csv and write output csv contain list of calls with all the calls in the csv, in additional we have set target function that re-write the (-1) value with the new elevator the algorithm choose for.
in the main class the heart of the project contain update time function that over of all the new calls that the algorithm decide to insert to the list, and the major function allocate elevator which the heart of the algorithm calculate the best elevator to give us with all parameters and calculated time between all elevators we got in the case.

## Results

Our best Results:

|Building B1-B5|Call Case|Average Waiting Time|Number on incomplete calls|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|B1|a|15.12|10|
|B2|b|19.12|9|
|B3|c|18.12|8|
|B4|d|17.12|7|
|B5|a|16.12|6|
|B4|b|12.12|5|

Information: the first column is the cases with the B1,B2,B3,B4,B5, the second column is the call cases a,b,c,d the third column is the average waiting time of all calls the forth column is  the number of incomplete calls mains that the algorithm is missed a calls.

As you can see our results after analyzing the code, after going over all the results for the different cases we decided to present the best results for us
that results give us a boost in motivation for develop and improve the code to maximum performance with the minimum of issues or errors.
